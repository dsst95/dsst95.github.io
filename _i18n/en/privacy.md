E-Mail-Address: <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#100;&#115;&#116;&#117;&#109;&#109;&#57;&#53;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#100;&#115;&#116;&#117;&#109;&#109;&#57;&#53;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>

If you contact me by e-mail, the data you provide will be stored by me in order to process your request.

The processed data includes
- Your name
- your e-mail address
- and, if applicable, your telephone number

I will delete the data as soon as storage is no longer necessary or restrict processing if there are statutory retention obligations.

## Rights of data subjects
As a data subject, you have the right to information, the right to rectification or erasure, the right to restriction of processing and the right to object to the processing of your data. If you have given me your consent, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.

Please send your objection or revocation informally to the above address.

You also have the right to data portability. You also have the right to complain to a supervisory authority about the processing. You can find a list of the relevant authorities at [https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html](https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html).

## Hosting
My host collects the following data that your browser transmits in log files:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display my website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to my legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

There is no tracking and I have no direct access to this data.

I use the following hoster for the provision of my website:

GitHub Inc.  
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St  
San Francisco, CA 94107  
United States  

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to my legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR in not having to maintain a server on my premises. Server location is USA.

Further information on objection and removal options vis-à-vis GitHub can be found at: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages)

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined as part of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies.

The processing of the data specified in this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). Further information can be found at: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1-the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1-the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors)

## Social plugins
I offer you the option of using so-called “social media buttons” on my website. To protect your data, I use the “Shariff” solution for implementation. This means that these buttons are only integrated on the website as a graphic that contains a link to the corresponding website of the button provider. By clicking on the graphic, you will be redirected to the services of the respective provider. Only then will your data be sent to the respective provider. If you do not click on the graphic, there will be no exchange between you and the providers of the social media buttons. Information about the collection and use of your data in the social networks can be found in the respective terms of use of the corresponding providers. You can find more information about the Shariff solution at [http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html](http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html).

## Modification of my Privacy Policy
I reserve the right to adapt this Privacy Policy occasionally, so that it continually meets the current legal requirements or add changes in my offer to this Privacy Policy (e.g. on introduction of new services). For your next visit the new Privacy Policy will apply.
